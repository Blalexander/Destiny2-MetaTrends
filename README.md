# Destiny MetaTrends

This app allows you to access data from an ever-growing library of game reports from the highest level players.  Each game report offers comprehensive data for every weapon and player in a game, which can be used to generate averages and highlight trends.  The app currently focuses on presenting the intrinsic and derived stats for every weapon, the combinations of weapons that yield the greatest success, and a section that allows for the direct comparison of weapons.  The next update in development will reintroduce the ability to look up individual players to get a full breakdown of their stats and trends and see how they compare against other users.

## Documentation 

The Weapon Charts section of the website is the default landing page.  It allows you to view detailed information about the intrinsic stats Bungie assigns to each weapon along with the statistics derived from all available player performances.  The Combine and Compare section lets you select a weapon to view either the most successful combinations players have found for it or create a direction comparison to any other weapon.
